# Ideal Trainn

Ideal Train is a tool to check the IP information from local files instead of using an API
## Setup
First Run `settings.py`, then press *Enter*

##### by default i used the [db-ip](https://db-ip.com/db/) lite csvs since its free *i am not able to upload all the files to github directly since the limit is 25mb* you can download them from their website or from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7cud54ym8pkl3t/AACLuhff7u6lIN9F0MFCPciia?dl=0) and rename the files to **ipCity.csv** / **ipCountry.csv** / **ipAsn.csv** then copy them to the dbs directory.
