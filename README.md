# This tool is to check the IP information from local files instead of using an API

#### First Run `settings.py`, press *Enter* for everything to get the default settings

##### by default i used the https://db-ip.com/db/ lite csvs since its free *i am not able to upload all the files to github directly since the limit is 25mb* you can download them from their website or from (here)[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7cud54ym8pkl3t/AACLuhff7u6lIN9F0MFCPciia?dl=0] and rename the files to **ipCity.csv** / **ipCountry.csv** / **ipAsn.csv** and copy them to the dbs directory.
